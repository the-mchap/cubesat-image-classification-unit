# üõ∞Ô∏è Image Classification Unit (ICU)

![Project Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Under%20Development-yellow)

Onboard CNN Image Classification for CubeSats, running on a low-power SBC. By processing data where it's collected, it saves precious downlink bandwidth and enables near-real-time decision-making in orbit.

## üöÄ Overview

CubeSat missions are bottlenecked by downlink bandwidth. The **Image Classification Unit (ICU)** tackles this by performing inference directly on the satellite. Using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on a Raspberry Pi Zero 2W, it identifies and prioritizes valuable imagery (e.g., wildfires, ships, clouds), ensuring that only the most critical data is transmitted to Earth.

## üß© Features

- **Near-Real-Time Inference:** Embedded CNN using TensorFlow Lite for onboard image classification.
- **Efficient Memory Management:** NOR Flash storage with tombstone-based garbage collection.
- **Modular Architecture:** Clear separation between the SBC (RPi Zero 2W) and the mission manager (PIC18F67J94) via UART.
- **Extensible Interface:** Configurable image selection criteria and robust testing/debugging tools.
